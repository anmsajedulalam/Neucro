### Hello there I am Sajid! 👋


I am a curious guy who has desire for tech and research. Trying to learn something each day. I love to code and build things. My current focus is to work with AI/ML/DL. At present actively looking for opportunities to collab in research and development related to data.


In short:

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn more about data science.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML/DL Projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with jobs.
- 💬 Ask me about giving me opportunities.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail me.
- 😄 Pronouns: He, Mr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think cooking is more like coding.
